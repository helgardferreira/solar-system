# Simple WebGL Solar System Project

This project is a WebGL (three.js) React web app with a 2D as well as a 3D representation of all the planets in our solar system (except Pluto of course.)

You can select a planet by clicking it in the 2D view for a more detailed perspective in the 3D view as well as some stats about the planet and some images pulled from nasa's open API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
